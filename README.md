Easy WP SMTP Vulnerability

The Easy WP SMTP Vulnerability plugin maintains what is called a changelog that documents all the changes within each update. The changelog is meant to be read so that a user can understand what an update is changing.

Normally when a vulnerability is being patched the plugin developers will note that a vulnerability is being patched. This gives the WordPress publisher the information they need to make an informed decision as to whether or not to update a plugin or wait.

A changelog that informs a publisher that an update is plugging a vulnerability allows that publisher to make an informed decision to update the plugin in order to avoid getting hacked.

The Easy WP SMTP plugin changelog only says that they are inserting an index.html file in a folder to prevent anyone from browsing it. That should be warning enough that this is an important update, but only if the publisher understands that peeking into the folder is dangerous.
